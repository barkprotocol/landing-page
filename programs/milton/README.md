## 1. Introduction

MILTON is a Solana-based token designed for [insert specific use case or purpose]. This documentation provides an overview of how the MILTON token works, its implementation details, and guidelines for integration and usage.

## 2. Token Specifications

- **Name**: MILTON
- **Symbol**: MILTON
- **Decimals**: 9
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Token Standard**: SPL Token (Solana Program Library) with support for Token-2022 program
- **Smart Contract Language**: Rust (using Anchor framework)
- **Transfer Fee**: 0.25% (configurable)
- **Mint Rate Limit**: 1 MILTON per second (configurable)

## 3. Smart Contract Overview

The MILTON token (MILTON) is implemented using the Anchor framework on the Solana blockchain. The smart contract consists of several key components:

- **Token Mint**: The central authority for creating new tokens.
- **Token Accounts**: Accounts that hold token balances for users.
- **Vesting Accounts**: Accounts that manage token vesting schedules.
- **Program**: The smart contract logic that governs token operations.

## 4. Key Functions

The MILTON token smart contract provides the following key functions:

### 4.1 Initialize Mint

Creates the token mint with specified parameters such as decimals, transfer fee percentage, and mint rate limit.

```typescript
static async initialize(
  program: Program<MiltonToken>,
  authority: Keypair,
  decimals: number = 9,
  tokenVersion: TokenVersion = "token",
  transferFeePercentage: number = 0.1,
  mintRateLimit: BN = new BN(1000000000) // 1 MILTON per second
): Promise<Milton>
```

### 4.2 Create Token Account

Creates a new token account for a given owner.

```typescript
async createTokenAccount(owner: PublicKey): Promise<PublicKey>
```

### 4.3 Mint Tokens

Mints new tokens to a specified token account, respecting the mint rate limit.

```typescript
async mintTo(tokenAccount: PublicKey, amount: BN): Promise<void>
```

### 4.4 Transfer Tokens

Transfers tokens between accounts, applying the transfer fee.

```typescript
async transfer(
  fromAccount: PublicKey,
  toAccount: PublicKey,
  owner: Keypair,
  amount: BN
): Promise<void>
```

### 4.5 Burn Tokens

Burns (destroys) a specified amount of tokens from a token account.

```typescript
async burn(tokenAccount: PublicKey, owner: Keypair, amount: BN): Promise<void>
```

### 4.6 Create Vesting Schedule

Creates a vesting schedule for a recipient, locking tokens for a specified period.

```typescript
async createVestingSchedule(
  recipient: PublicKey,
  totalAmount: BN,
  startTimestamp: number,
  endTimestamp: number
): Promise<PublicKey>
```

### 4.7 Claim Vested Tokens

Allows a recipient to claim their vested tokens according to the vesting schedule.

```typescript
async claimVestedTokens(vestingAccount: PublicKey, recipient: PublicKey): Promise<void>
```

### 4.8 Get Token Metadata

Retrieves metadata associated with the token.

```typescript
async getTokenMetadata(): Promise<any>
```

## 5. Token Economics

The MILTON token implements the following economic features:

- **Transfer Fee**: A 0.1% fee is applied to all transfers. This fee is sent to the token authority and can be used for various purposes such as ecosystem development or token buybacks.
- **Mint Rate Limiting**: New token minting is limited to 1 MILTON per second to prevent inflation and maintain token value.
- **Vesting**: Tokens can be locked in vesting schedules, allowing for gradual distribution to recipients. This feature can be used for team allocations, investor distributions, or other controlled token releases.

## 6. Integration Guide

To integrate the MILTON token into your project:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install @coral-xyz/anchor @solana/web3.js @solana/spl-token
   ```

2. Import the MILTON token class:
   ```typescript
   import { Milton } from './path/to/milton';
   ```

3. Initialize the MILTON token:
   ```typescript
   const milton = await Milton.initialize(program, authority);
   ```

4. Use the provided methods to interact with the token:
   ```typescript
   // Create a token account
   const tokenAccount = await milton.createTokenAccount(owner.publicKey);

   // Mint tokens
   await milton.mintTo(tokenAccount, new BN(1000000000));

   // Transfer tokens
   await milton.transfer(fromAccount, toAccount, owner, new BN(500000000));
   ```

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Authority Management**: The token authority has significant control over the token. Ensure proper key management and consider implementing multi-signature authority.
- **Rate Limiting**: While mint rate limiting is implemented, ensure your application respects these limits to prevent transaction failures.
- **Vesting**: Carefully manage vesting schedules and ensure recipients understand the vesting process.
- **Transfer Fees**: Be aware of the transfer fee when calculating token amounts in your application.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can the transfer fee be changed after token initialization?
A: The current implementation does not allow changing the transfer fee after initialization. Consider adding an instruction to the smart contract if this flexibility is required.

Q: How does the vesting schedule work?
A: Vesting schedules lock a total amount of tokens for a recipient, which are gradually released between a start and end timestamp. Recipients can claim their vested tokens as they become available.

Q: Is there a maximum supply for MILTON tokens?
A: While there's no hard cap on the total supply, the mint rate limiting feature helps control token inflation. You can implement additional supply management logic in your smart contract if needed.

Q: Can MILTON tokens be used with other Solana wallets and exchanges?
A: Yes, MILTON tokens are compatible with any wallet or exchange that supports Solana SPL tokens. However, these platforms should be aware of the transfer fee mechanism when handling MILTON tokens.
